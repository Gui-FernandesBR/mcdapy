MonteCarlo Class
-----------------

The Monte Carlo class is based on other classes in the package. The concept
is really simple: you create a Monte Carlo object, and then you run it. The
Monte Carlo object will generate the results for each of the iterations (n) in 
a loop.

To get to know more about Monte Carlo simulations in general, please refer to
the Wikipedia article on the subject.
